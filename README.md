# Intro

This is a general bibliography about mobility and "big data" such as CDRs, XDRs, with a little bias towards mobility and gender, and some about mobility and emergency response. There's also a bit of "negative bias" against other bibliography fields that are not as well-indexed online such as some geographical literature, some gender literature and some transportation litrature. A merge with this bibliographies would be ideal.

We used the following command to generate an `html` file for "visual inspection"

```

This is not a comprehensive bibliography, and may contain many errors. It's, however, a starting point.
